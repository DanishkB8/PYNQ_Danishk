# projects

## Overview

This folder contains hardware overlay files and Jupyter notebooks for various projects designed for the PYNQ-ZU board. This repository includes pre-built hardware overlays in the form of `.bit` and `.hwh` files, along with Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to utilize these overlays.



## Features

- **Overlay Files**: Pre-built hardware designs for the PYNQ-ZU board.
  - **`.bit` Files**: FPGA bitstream files for configuring the FPGA.
  - **`.hwh` Files**: Hardware description files providing metadata about the hardware design.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks demonstrating how to use the overlays and execute various projects.

## Tools Used

- **PYNQ Framework**: Provides a Python interface for programming and interacting with the PYNQ-ZU board.
- **Vivado**: Used for designing and implementing the FPGA hardware components (if modifications or custom designs are needed).
- **Vitis HLS**: Utilized for high-level synthesis (if custom HLS code is used or developed).
